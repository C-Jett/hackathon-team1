# Ninja Project Hackathon - Team 1 (Aug 8 - 9, 2018)

This project was put together by [Ryan Schumacher](/jrschumacher), [Cody Jett](/c-jett), and [Victor Nguyen](/victorynguyen75). 

## Design

The design of this project was to create a mobile version of the [HCAT Birmingham Site](http://www.hcat-birmingham.com/).

The goal was for the frontend to pull from the backend and run aggregations and other comparison operators. Unfortuately, we were unable to get to that point.

## Install and Run

```
npm install
npm start
```
